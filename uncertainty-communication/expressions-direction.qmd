## Qualitative description of the direction and/or magnitude of uncertainty using words or symbols 

Words or an ordinal scale describing how much a source of uncertainty affects the assessment or its conclusion (e.g. low, medium or high uncertainty; conservative, very conservative or non-conservative; unlikely, likely or very likely; or symbols indicating the direction and magnitude of uncertainty: —, –,-,+, ++, +++) Because the meaning of such expressions is ambiguous, EFSA’s Uncertainty Analysis GD recommends that they should not be used unless they are accompanied by a quantitative definition (see [UA](https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5123))
