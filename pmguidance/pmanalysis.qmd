## Key principles when conducting case-specific assessments
<!-- SO p39 -->

# What is a case-specific assessment?
A case-specific assessment is needed when there is no standardised procedure for the type of assessment in hand, and when parts of the assessment use standardised procedure but other parts are case-specific or deviate from the standardised procedure (e.g. for refinement or urgency), and for calibrating standardised procedures when they are first established or revised. 
:::

- The uncertainty analysis should start at a level that is appropriate to the assessment in hand. For assessments where data to quantify uncertainty is available and/or where suitable quantitative methods are already established, this may be included in the initial assessment. In other assessments, it may be best to start with a simple approach, unless it is evident at the outset that more complex approaches are needed.

- Uncertainty analysis should be refined as far as is needed to inform decision-making. 
  -- This point is reached either when there is sufficient certainty about the question or quantity of interest for the decision-makers to make a decision with the level of certainty they require, or 
  -- if it becomes apparent that achieving the desired level of uncertainty is unfeasible or too costly and the decision-makers decide instead to manage the uncertainty without further refinement of the analysis.

- Refinements of the uncertainty analysis using more complex or resource-intensive methods and options should be targeted on those sources of uncertainty where they will contribute most efficiently to improving the characterisation of uncertainty, taking account of their influence on the assessment conclusion and the cost and feasibility of the refinement. 

- The characterisation of overall uncertainty must integrate the contributions of identified sources of uncertainties that have been expressed in different ways.

# What is a standardised assessment procedure?
Standardised assessment procedures with accepted provision for uncertainty are common in many areas of EFSAâ€™s work, especially for regulated products, and are subject to periodic review.

## Key principles for urgent assessments

# What is an urgent assessment?
TO BE TUNED _ TAKE FRO GLOSSARY? 

In some situations, e.g. emergencies, EFSA may be required to provide an urgent assessment in very limited time and the approach taken must be adapted accordingly. Uncertainty is generally increased in such situations, and may be a major driver for decision-making. Characterisation of uncertainty is therefore still necessary, despite the urgency of the assessment. However, the approach to providing it must be scaled to fit within the time and resources available.
