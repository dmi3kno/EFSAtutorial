<!-- SO p20, last bullet point -->
It is therefore important to quantify the overall impact of as many as possible of the identified uncertainties, and identify any that cannot be quantified. The most direct way to achieve this is to try to quantify the overall impact of all identified uncertainties, as this will reveal any that cannot be quantified.
