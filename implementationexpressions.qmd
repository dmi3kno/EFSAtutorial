title: "Expressions of Uncertainty"
---

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(DT)
```


Here we will have the interactive data table of examples. Currently, we plan to have the following fields in the table:

- Title
- DOI
- Panel
- Expression of uncertainty (from the nine expressions)
- Quantitative method for uncertainty analysis
- Qualitative method for uncertainty analysis 
- Description

The dataframe below is provided as a placeholder.

```{r}
#| echo: false
mtcars2 = mtcars[, c(1:5, 9)]
mtcars2$am = factor(mtcars$am, c(0, 1), c('automatic', 'manual'))
# search for Ma or Me
datatable(
  mtcars2, colnames = c('model' = 1),
  filter = list(position = 'top', clear = FALSE),
  options = list(
    search = list(regex = TRUE, caseInsensitive = FALSE, search = 'M[ae]'),
    pageLength = 5
  )
)
```
