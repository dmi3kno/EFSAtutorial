    "title": "Dividing the assessment into parts",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Often an assessment will comprise a number of main parts (e.g. exposure and hazard in a chemical risk assessment) and smaller, subsidiary parts (e.g. individual parameters, studies, or lines of evidence within the exposure or hazard assessment).\nThe uncertainty analysis may also be divided into parts. Assessors should choose at what level to conduct it:\n\nEvaluate all uncertainties collectively, for the assessment as a whole.\nDivide the uncertainty analysis into parts, which evaluate uncertainties separately in major parts of the scientific assessment (e.g. exposure and hazard in a risk assessment). Then, combine the parts of the uncertainty analysis and include also any other identified uncertainties that relate to other parts of the scientific assessment as a whole, so as to characterise the overall uncertainty.\nDivide the uncertainty analysis into still smaller parts, corresponding to still smaller parts of the scientific assessment (e.g. every input of a calculation or model). Evaluate uncertainty collectively within each of the smaller parts, combine them into the main parts, and combine those to characterise overall uncertainty for the whole assessment.\n\nIf the uncertainty analysis will be divided into parts, assessors will need to combine them to characterise overall uncertainty. Assessors should define in advance how the parts will be combined, as this will increase transparency and rigour. It is recommended to use a conceptual model diagram (see glossary for explanation) to show how the parts will be combined. The parts may be combined by expert judgement (Section 12.6), or by calculation (Sections 13, 14 or 15) if assessors quantify the uncertainty for each part and can specify an appropriate quantitative or logical model to combine them. Calculation is likely to give more reliable results, but should be weighed against the additional work involved.\nAssessors should judge what is best suited to the needs of each assessment. For example, it may be more efficient to evaluate uncertainty for different parts separately if they require different expertise (e.g. toxicity and exposure). Evaluating all uncertainties collectively (first option in point (2) above) is generally quicker and superficially simpler but requires integrating them all subjectively by expert judgement, which may be less reliable than evaluating different parts of the uncertainty analysis separately, if they are then combined by calculation. For this reason, it is recommended to treat separately those parts of the assessment that are affected by larger uncertainties (identified by a simple initial prioritisation, see Section 8).\nWhen a part of the scientific assessment is treated separately in the uncertainty analysis, it is not necessary to evaluate immediately all of the uncertainties affecting it; some of them can be set to one side and considered later as part of the overall characterisation of uncertainty, if this is more convenient for the assessor. However, it is recommended that only the lesser uncertainties are deferred to the overall characterisation, since it will be more reliable to combine the larger uncertainties by calculation.\nWhen the scientific assessment includes a quantitative or logical model, assessors may find it convenient to quantify uncertainty separately for every parameter of the model. In such cases, it will still be necessary to identify additional uncertainties that are not quantified within the model, e.g. uncertainties relating to the structure of the model (see Section 7.2) and take them into account in the characterisation of overall uncertainty (Section 16). In other cases, assessors might find it sufficient to analyse all the uncertainties affecting a model collectively (simplest option in point (2) above), or for major parts of the model without separating the individual parameters (intermediate option in point (2))."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Prioritising sources of uncertainty may be useful at different stages of the assessment and uncertainty analysis. In the early stages, it can be used to select more important uncertainties to be analysed by more refined methods, e.g. to be evaluated individually rather than collectively, to be expressed with probabilities or distributions rather than bounds, to be elicited by more rather than less formal methods, etc. Prioritisation can also be used during the course of an assessment, to identify parts of the assessment where it might be beneficial to search for more data, use more complex models, or invite additional experts. At the end of the assessment, it may be useful to prioritise uncertainties to identify potential areas for further research.\nPrioritisation, at any stage of the assessment, should be based on the contribution of individual sources of uncertainty to the uncertainty of the assessment as a whole. This is determined by a combination of the magnitude of each uncertainty and how much it affects the result of the assessment, both of which need to be taken into account [SO5.7].\nThe relative influence of different uncertainties can be assessed in a simple and approximate way using qualitative methods based on expert judgement. An ordinal scale can be used to express expert judgements of the magnitude and/or direction of impact of each uncertainty on the question or quantity of interest, as in ‘uncertainty tables’ [SO10.5 and 10.6]. Or separate ordinal scales could be used to express judgements of the magnitude of each uncertainty and its influence, as in the Numeral, Unit, Spread, Assessment and Pedigree (NUSAP) approach [SO10.4].\nWhen the assessment involves a calculation or quantitative model, the contributions of uncertainties about the model inputs can be assessed rigorously by sensitivity analysis. These range from simple ‘what if’ calculations and ‘minimal assessment’ (EFSA, 2014a) to sophisticated sensitivity analyses [see SO12] for which specialist help might be required (Section 1.7). The influence of uncertainties relating to choices regarding the structure of the model or assessment may need to be addressed by repeating the assessment with alternative choices. Prioritisation at the early stages of an assessment must necessarily be done by expert judgement or by sensitivity analysis using a preliminary model, as the assessment model is still under development."

It is therefore recommended that assessors use the right column of Table 1 (referring to [SO8.1] for details and explanation) as a guide to what types of uncertainty to look for in the methods of their assessment.\nAssessors are advised to avoid spending excessive time trying to match uncertainties to the types listed in Table 1 or other frameworks: the purpose of the lists is to facilitate identification of uncertainties, not to classify them.\nAssessors should determine which of the uncertainties they identify in an assessment are standard and which are non-standard (Section 7.1), as this will affect their treatment in subsequent stages of the uncertainty analysis."

    "text": "In order to evaluate uncertainty, the questions and/or quantities of interest for the assessment must be well-defined. This applies both to the assessment as a whole and to different parts of the uncertainty analysis, if it is separated into parts. Any ambiguity in the definition of questions or quantities of interest will add extra uncertainty and make the evaluation more difficult. When a question or quantity of interest is not already well-defined for the purpose of scientific assessment, assessors should define it well for the purpose of uncertainty analysis.\nA quantity or question of interest is well-defined if, at least in principle, it could be determined in such a way that assessors would be sure to agree on the answer. A practical way to achieve this is by specifying an experiment, study or procedure that could be undertaken, at least in principle, and which would determine the true answer for the question or quantity with certainty [see SO5.1 for more discussion]. For example:\n\na well-defined measure for a quantity of interest, and the time, population or location, and conditions (e.g. status quo or with specified management actions) for which the measure will be considered;\nfor a question of interest, the presence or absence of one or more clearly-defined states, conditions, mechanisms, etc., of interest for the assessment, and the time, population or location, and conditions (e.g. status quo or with specified management actions) for which this will be considered;\nthe result of a clearly-defined scientific study, procedure or calculation, which is established (e.g. in legislation or guidance) as being relevant for the assessment.\n\nWhen drafting the definition of each question or quantity of interest, check each word in turn. Identify words that are ambiguous (e.g. high), or imply a risk management judgement (e.g. negligible, safe). Replace or define them with words that are, as far as possible, unambiguous and free of risk management connotations or, where appropriate, with numbers.\nSometimes the Terms of Reference for an assessment are very open, e.g. requesting a review of the literature on an area of science. In such cases, assessors should seek to ensure the conclusions they produce either refer to well-defined quantities, or contain welldefined statements that can be considered as answers to well-defined questions, in one of the three forms listed above (point 2, options a–c). This is necessary both for transparency and so that assessors can evaluate and express the uncertainty associated with their conclusions."

    "text": "Welcome to this tutorial on how to identify, characterize and communicate uncertainties in EFSA’s scientific assessments.\nIdentifying and characterizing uncertainties, and explaining their implications for assessment conclusions, is an important element of EFSA’s risk assessment process.\nThis tutorial is designed to help you get access the two EFSA cross-cutting guidances on uncertainty - the Guidance on Uncertainty Analysis in Scientific Assessmenst and the Guidance on Communication of Uncertainty.\nAs part of EFSA’s commitment to transparency,.\nThe EFSA guidance on uncertainty analysis in scientific assessments brings more clarity on how it can be performed in a structured, transparent and unambiguous way.\nThis online tutorial will enhance the understanding and enable the practical implementation of the guidance document on uncertainty analysis in scientific assessments. It offers a strong link between the theory and practice by including the recent scientific opinions as case studies demonstrating how the uncertainty analysis can be applied across the various EFSA scientific areas and across various conditions. Aspects of uncertainty communication and the impact of uncertainty information on risk managers’ decision-making are also included.\nBy the end of the course, participants should be able to understand and describe:\n\nWhy uncertainty analysis is helpful in scientific assessments\nThe general principles of uncertainty analysis\nTerminology used in uncertainty analysis\nMain steps in uncertainty analysis and, in particular:\n\nPlanning the assessment strategy\nIdentifying sources of uncertainty\nEvaluating individual sources of uncertainty, both in qualitative and quantitative ways\nEvaluating combined uncertainty, both in qualitative and quantitative ways\nDescribing the unquantified uncertainties\nCommunicating the uncertainty information to their main target audience\n\n\nThe training materials will be a mixture of theory and applied real case studies taken from different EFSA contexts, including regulatory and non-regulatory assessments."

We introduce the expressions of uncertainty used at EFSA and invite the user to select one of the two sections to proceed\nThe rest of the content on the page is split between the communicator, and the assessor role. The user has the opportunity to select the other role and explore the content in the respective section. The Communicator section provides guidance for communication on the entry-level and the informed level, while the Assessor section provides guidance for the technical level.\nFinally, both the Communicator and the Assessor roles share the section for the Specific Guidances, consisting of the 9 types of expressions of uncertainty as shown in Figure 4. The content of the Specific Guidances varies depending on the role (the Communicator is shows the entry and informed level and the Assessor is shown the technical level)\nEach of the specific guidances (for assessors) is accompanied by a short text and links to best-practice examples (i.e. where these Specific Guidances were followed) in the implementation section (below).\nWe will also refer to additional information in the Principles and Methods opinion on reporting and communicating uncertainties (Ch 15 and 16)."
