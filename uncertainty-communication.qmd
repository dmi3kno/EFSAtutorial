## Introduction transcript

Welcome to the page for the EFSA guidance on communication of uncertainty

This page takes you through the suggestions provided for communicators and assessors. 

The guidance consists of a series of questions helping you to tailor the uncertainty communication message targeting the audience at the “entry”, “informed” and “technical” levels.

You can access these checklists by clicking one of the buttons below. 

You can also learn about the principles behind the EFSA guidance on communication of uncertainty. 

Note that the text in this tutorial is a condensed extract from the EFSA guidance on communication of uncertainty. If something is unclear or feels incomplete, or if you want to learn more, we recommend you to consult the original document. Always refer to the guidance documents as your primary source! 

We hope you enjoy the material!

## Principles of uncertainty communication


- [Principles of Uncertainty Communication](principles-and-methods/uncertainty-communication-principles.qmd) including the Approximate Probability Scale.
- [Communicating Scientific Uncertainties](principles-and-methods/uncertainty-communication-principles.qmd), covering risk communication mandate, risk perception and the uncertainty communicaiton challenges.
- Proper [audience targeting](principles-and-methods/uncertainty-communication-principles.qmd).

## Expressions of uncertainty

Messages about uncertainty need to be based on information that is provided in EFSA’s scientific assessments. Therefore, this section describes the main types of expressions of uncertainty that are expected to result from uncertainty analyses following EFSA’s Uncertainty Analysis GD.

- [Unqualified conclusion](uncertainty-communication/expressions-unqualified.qmd), with no expression of uncertainty
- Description of [sources of uncertainty](uncertainty-communication/expressions-sources.qmd) 
- Qualitative description of the [direction and/or magnitude](uncertainty-communication/expressions-direction.qmd) of uncertainty using words or symbols
- [Inconclusive assessment](uncertainty-communication/expressions-inconclusive.qmd)
- A [precise probability](uncertainty-communication/expressions-precise.qmd)
- An [approximate probability](uncertainty-communication/expressions-approximate.qmd)
- A [probability distribution](uncertainty-communication/expressions-distribution.qmd)
- A [two-dimensional probability](uncertainty-communication/expressions-2d.qmd) distribution
