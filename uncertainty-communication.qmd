## Introduction transcript

>[in prep]
>Welcome to the page on Uncertainty Communication! 

>The pupose of the section is to introduce you to the "Guidance on Communication of Uncertainty in Scientific Assessments". The material for this page is heavy based on the [Principles of Uncertainty Communication](principles-and-methods/uncertainty-communication-principles.qmd) and we strongly recomend that you start your journey into the world of uncertainty communication there.

>We divided the material on this page into two sections: there's a section for uncertainty communicators and another one for the assessors. The presentation of the material also varies by the preparation level of the target audience. The material for the Communicators covers the Entry and Informed levels, while the Assessors are encouraged to refer to guidance for communication on the Informed and Technical levels. 

>Use one of the buttons below to proceed to the next page, where you will be presented with a communication checklist and the corresponding recommendations addressing the various aspects of uncertainty communication for the different audience levels.

## Expressions of uncertainty

Messages about uncertainty need to be based on information that is provided in EFSA’s scientific assessments. Therefore, this section describes the main types of expressions of uncertainty that are expected to result from uncertainty analyses following EFSA’s Uncertainty Analysis GD.

- [Unqualified conclusion](uncertainty-communication/expressions-unqualified.qmd), with no expression of uncertainty
- Description of a [source of uncertainty](uncertainty-communication/expressions-sources.qmd) 
- Qualitative description of the [direction and/or magnitude](uncertainty-communication/expressions-direction.qmd) of uncertainty using words or symbols
- [Inconclusive assessment](uncertainty-communication/expressions-inconclusive.qmd)
- A [precise probability](uncertainty-communication/expressions-precise.qmd)
- An [approximate probability](uncertainty-communication/expressions-approximate.qmd)
- A [probability distribution](uncertainty-communication/expressions-distribution.qmd)
- A [two-dimensional probability](uncertainty-communication/expressions-2d.qmd) distribution
