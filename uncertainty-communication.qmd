## Introduction transcript

Welcome to the page for the EFSA guidance on communication of uncertainty

This page takes you through the suggestions provided for communicators and assessors. 

The guidance consists of a series of questions helping you to tailor the uncertainty communication message targeting the audience at the “entry”, “informed” and “technical” levels.

You can access these checklists by clicking one of the buttons below. 

You can also learn about the principles behind the EFSA guidance on communication of uncertainty. 

Note that the text in this tutorial is a condensed extract from the EFSA guidance on communication of uncertainty. If something is unclear or feels incomplete, or if you want to learn more, we recommend you to consult the original document. Always refer to the guidance documents as your primary source! 

We hope you enjoy the material!

## Principles of uncertainty communication


- [Principles of Uncertainty Communication](principles-and-methods/uncertainty-communication-principles.qmd).
- [Communicating Scientific Uncertainties](principles-and-methods/uncertainty-communication-principles.qmd), covering risk communication mandate, risk perception and the uncertainty communicaiton challenges.

The Uncertainty Analysis GD contains several options for carrying out an uncertainty analysis. The Communication of Uncertainty GD provides recommendations for communicating the types of expressions of uncertainty that are normally produced when uncertainty analysis is conducted by following those options. It does not include expressions that are discouraged by the
Uncertainty Analysis GD, or other expressions that may be generated by some more specialised methods and the outputs of some methods for sensitivity analysis.

It is currently expected that, in many assessments, the conclusion, summary and abstract of the assessment will not contain expressions of uncertainty. This may arise in two types of situation, as indicated in the description for ‘unqualified conclusions’.

## Expressions of uncertainty

- [Unqualified conclusion](uncertainty-communication/expressions-unqualified.qmd), with no expression of uncertainty
- Description of [sources of uncertainty](uncertainty-communication/expressions-sources.qmd) 
- Qualitative description of the [direction and/or magnitude](uncertainty-communication/expressions-direction.qmd) of uncertainty using words or symbols
- [Inconclusive assessment](uncertainty-communication/expressions-inconclusive.qmd)
- A [precise probability](uncertainty-communication/expressions-precise.qmd)
- An [approximate probability](uncertainty-communication/expressions-approximate.qmd)
- A [probability distribution](uncertainty-communication/expressions-distribution.qmd)
- A [two-dimensional probability](uncertainty-communication/expressions-2d.qmd) distribution
