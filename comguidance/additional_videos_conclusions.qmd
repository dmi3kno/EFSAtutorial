## Text

> Explain that implementing UA GD implies identifying sources of uncertainty and therefore it can be useful to list them in the assessment. Describe different ways to list sources of uncertainty, e.g. those that have been considered and those that have not been considered. Go through some of the recommendations given by the UC GD.

> Explain that when the experts are not able to conclude, the conclusion of an assessment is inconclusive and that this is a way to express uncertainty. Go through the recommendations given by the UC GD on how to report an inconclusive assessment.
