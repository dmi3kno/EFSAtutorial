title: "Precise probability"

# A precise probability. 

A single number (in EFSA outputs: a percentage between 0% and 100%) quantifying the likelihood of either: 
  - A specified answer to a question (e.g. a ‘yes’ answer to a ‘yes/no’ question) 
  - A specified quantity lying in a specified range of values, or above or below a specified value (e.g. 90% probability that between 10 and 100 infected organisms will enter the EU in 2019; 5% probability that more than 100 infected organisms will enter).

>Note that the term "precise" is used here to refer to how the probability is expressed, as a single number, and does not imply that it is actually known with absolute precision, which is not possible
